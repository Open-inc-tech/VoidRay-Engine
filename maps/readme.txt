How to create or add a map to have multiple levels or just for testing?
From this folder, you can use pre-made levels and maps.
The maps must be in JSON format; others won't work. Place them in the folder where the maps are, but not in the same folder as the engine.
To check if you have maps, when the engine is running, a new "maps" folder should automatically be created, where you can simply add your own maps or already made ones. In the menu, you can choose which map you want to use.
